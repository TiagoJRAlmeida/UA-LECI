# 2nd Derivative Filter Implementation on FPGA

## üìã Project Overview

This project involves designing, simulating, synthesizing, and implementing a **2nd derivative filter** on a Terasic DE2-115 FPGA kit. The filter highlights peak moments in an input signal by approximating the second derivative using discrete samples.

## üéØ Objective

Implement a digital system that:
- Reads an 8-bit signed triangular wave signal from a 256x8-bit ROM
- Processes the signal using the 2nd derivative approximation formula
- Stores the filtered output in a 256x8-bit RAM
- Displays both input (ROM) and output (RAM) values on hexadecimal displays

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Specifications

**Filter Formula:**

![Filter Formula](images/filter-formula.png "Filter Formula")

**Signal Characteristics:**
- Input signal: Triangular wave with 60s period
- Sampling frequency: 2Hz
- Total duration: 128 seconds
- Data format: 8-bit signed values

**FPGA Interface:**
- `START`: KEY0
- `FILTER_ON`: SW(0)
- `RESET_RAM`: KEY1
- `RESET`: KEY2 (system reset)
- `HEX3...HEX0`: ROM content (input signal)
- `HEX7...HEX4`: RAM content (filtered output)

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 - ROM Address Generator
Implemented an address generator to read signed data from the ROM using the provided `TriangSignal_ROM256x8.vhd` file.

### Phase 2 - RAM Address Generator and Reset
Implemented address generation for RAM with `RESET_RAM` functionality to fill RAM with x"00" using the 50 MHz system clock.

### Phase 3 - Delay Line Storage
Created a serial-in parallel-out shift register (delay line) that stores 3 consecutive 8-bit input samples for the filter calculation.

### Phase 4 - Arithmetic Unit
Designed a computational unit that implements the 2nd derivative formula using the 3 stored samples and writes results to RAM.

### Phase 5 - Control Unit (State Machine)
Developed a finite state machine controller that:
- Starts with RAM reset
- Manages the filtering process
- Handles all control signals and system interface
